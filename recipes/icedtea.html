        <h3>This is the Real Long Island Iced Tea recipe</h3>
        <p>There's a lot of confusion about how to make this recipe and where it originally it's from,
            <br>so this is to make it clear that actual tea is not one of the ingredients. This is a mixture of
            <br>different alcohols and some soda and juice.
